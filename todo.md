### Story Ideas/GamePlay
- [] Have it so that the player goes and runs across a level platform, there's soem sort of words or soemthing
' night man runnith '   night man falls in the night.
maybe also have a cool thing where he falls down (looked like a cool effect when i did it at the edge), 'night man enters the void'.
